# TeamConnect

> **Real-time collaboration meets AI intelligence—turning messy group chats into structured, actionable workflows.**

TeamConnect is a purpose-built communication platform designed for **engineering and academic teams** who need more than just "chat." It combines low-latency, WebSocket-based real-time messaging with an intelligent AI layer that parses conversations to extract context, summarize long threads, and highlight action items.

Unlike social apps (WhatsApp) built for engagement or enterprise suites (Teams) that can become noisy firehoses, TeamConnect focuses on **signal-over-noise**. It provides a distraction-free environment where project history is preserved and transformed into retrieval-ready intelligence, ensuring users can catch up in seconds—not minutes.

## ❓ The Problem

In fast-paced project environments, **information overload** is a critical bottleneck:
*   **Context Decay**: Key decisions made 200 messages ago get buried under "catch-up" chatter.
*   **The "Catch-Up" Tax**: Team members returning after a few hours offline struggle to find relevant tasks without scrolling endlessly.
*   **Tool Mismatch**: Social apps lack structure for work, while full enterprise tools are often too heavy or expensive for agile student/project groups.

**TeamConnect** solves this by integrating **AI summarization directly into the message loop**, acting as a real-time scribe that organizes chaos into clarity.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of TeamConnect is to solve information overload in team chats by combining real-time communication with AI-powered assistance.  
AI is used only where it adds value—such as summarizing conversations and extracting important points—while the core messaging system remains fast, secure, and reliable.
